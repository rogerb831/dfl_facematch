**Facial recognition based intelligent sorting for DeepFaceLab.**

This tool adds facial recognition to DeepFaceLab so that you can quickly sort through your "aligned" folders and separate the faces you want from scenes with multiple faces. This definitely saves time in the installation process

**Installation**

The steps to install are as follows

 1. Download the package by clicking the green "code" button above and select the zip download option
 2. Extract the contents of the zip file directly into your DeepFaceLab folder so that all of the files are in the folder that has all of the numbered batch scripts
 3. Run the setup.bat. This will download and install the necessary dependencies into your DeepFaceLab environment. If this makes you nervous, make a copy of your DeepFaceLab folder before running setup.
 4. You will now have two new batch scripts to use in helping you sort faces
	 - 4.2) **data_src sort facial recognition optional.bat** - can be used to sort face in the data_src folder
	 - 5.2) **data_dst sort facial recognition optional.bat** - can be used to sort face in the data_dst folder
